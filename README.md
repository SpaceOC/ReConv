# What is a ReConv?
- ReConv is a program for converting charts from one FNF engine to another.

# How to use?
1. Launch the program
2. Once the “ReConvData” folder appears, drop the folder (it is recommended that the folder have a name equal to the name of the chart song, for example if the song is “Tutorial” then the folder name is “tutorial”) with the chart, events.json (if any) and the .ogg files of the song (Inst.ogg and Voice.ogg (if any)) into the “psych” folder (which is in the “ReConvData” folder).
 - The program itself converts the chart to a chart for Codename Engine
3. ~~Profit~~ Done! Now you have ready charts for Codename Engine in your result folder!

# Why Haxe?
- I tried to do it in C++, but ran into huge difficulties. Someday (or maybe never) I will rewrite it in one of the two languages: Go, C++

# Warning!
- The program is not perfect and may generate errors. 
- Do not expect it to do the conversion perfectly! You will still have to tweak after it!!!

Good luck :D
